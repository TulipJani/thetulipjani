          started messing with code and ideas at 14. tried 3d at first, with lightwave. then blender 2.8, maya, 3ds max. love creating 3d scenes, environments, product shots, documentary films. doing all of this until i get into my diploma. then got into web dev, felt too generic, so focused on creative development, animations, motions, pinteresty-design. cloned awwwarded websites, and made PRETTY COOOL STUFFF.

          idk where my life wants me to go. always had this dream of watching comets, being scientist, then got into 3d. wanted to create my virtual world, then got into programming and development. always wanted to make games, but could't afford gaming system. (btw ngl worked on all of this in 8gb, i5-1st gen processor).

          journey
        </h2>
        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#888888] leading-8 mt-4">
          completed my diploma in 2025.<br/> won 2 hackathons. <br/> Got 1st place (winners) at HackdotSlash 5.0 at SVNIT, Surat on 1st-2nd Feb 2025. (it was first win, cannot forget how we were about to leave, and were hopeless but turns out we were youngest in the hack, and the idea turned into startup.) <br/> Got 2nd (but tie) at Hackspire at Adani University. Another hack where the team was super confident and that's how we won. crazy good frontend, super confident presentations, and ofc youngest in the university.
        </p>
        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#888888] leading-8 mt-4">hackathons taught me a lot of things, it is the place, the time, the environment where i find the best version of myself. the most confident, smart, trying to figuring out the shit and doing the <i>jugaads</i> and feeling proud and grateful for the best team.</p>
<p class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#888888] leading-8 mt-4">
        so im hackathon guy, while writing this, we are select for the odoo hackathon 2025, where we are one of the 250 teams from 16k registrations. hoping that i could win this one, and get a macbook.</p>

           made vfx videos, cgi videos, and now in the era of AI, got in love with AI content. no, i'm not talking about the brainrot you see on socials, but the <i>creative,</i> the one for<b> brands</b> and the one where a creative artist like me, can express. 
          AI art, AI filmmaking, and not only playing with the tools, but making the best creations, the ones having WOW factor, <br/> that's what i create. that's what i want to create.
        </p>
        <p> 
        made first best film = dwarka documentary; during buildathon by 100xEngineers during Nov 2024. they loved, gave feedbacks, and it was super fun to work for the whole weekend and having university exams next day. altho i couldn't make into BLR, but i'm proud of it, and it was stepping step into my AI journey. then i kept on making videos, ads, stories, using FREE AI tools. i got this channel, and page. i dont have big numbers but im proud of the quality of the content. and yeah, as AI gets better every single day, i'm also improving and learning. this is revolution, and it's fun. what a great time to be alive!!
